      <h3><strong>Web Development & Programming</strong></h3>
      <p>I started learing <strong>Web Development</strong> on <strong><a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/" target="_blank">freeCodeCamp website</a></strong>.
         The first thing that I started with was the <strong>Responsive Web Design</strong> course.</p>
    </li>
    <li class="event">
      <p>I met with a lot of new things in the world of web development, but I wasn't interested that much, in the time, so I've completely stopped learning.</p>
    </li>
    <li class="event" data-date="2023">
      <p>In 2023 I found my way back to learning <strong>Web Development and Programming</strong> overall. I finished <strong>freeCodeCamp</strong> course and I received my first <strong><a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/Dvorinka/responsive-web-design" target="_blank">Certificate</a></strong>.</p>
    </li>
    <li class="event">
      <p>After finishing my HTML course I started learning little bit of Javascript (JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures) - I finished this course with some help from ChatGPT 'cause I did not understand Javascript that much in the time.</p>
    </li>
    <li class="event" data-date="2024">
      <p>This was the year of my biggest accomplishments, I started learning on Udemy - in fact I started with ZTM courses, which helped me ALOT in the whole IT sphere. My interest moved more to Ethical hacking and to tools like Raspberry PI, which I got for Christmass from my parents. I also started with Python.</p>
    </li>
    <li class="event">
      <p>I switched high schools (I went from OAUH to SGaSOÅ ) and I finally started to learn IT even in school. The first thing that I started learning was programming in the C and C++ languages.</p>

      <h3><strong>Video Editing & Graphic design</strong></h3>
      <p>I started with <strong>Video Editing</strong> all by myself. Firstly I was editing simple short gaming footage for myself. I did all of that on my former phone in app called <strong><a href="https://kinemaster.com/" target="_blank">Kinemaster</a></strong>.</p>
