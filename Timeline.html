      <p>After finishing my HTML course I started learning little bit of Javascript (JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures) - I finished this course with some help from ChatGPT 'cause I did not understand Javascript that much in the time.</p>

      <p>This was the year of my biggest accomplishments, I started learning on Udemy - in fact I started with ZTM courses, which helped me ALOT in the whole IT sphere. My interest moved more to Ethical hacking and to tools like Raspberry PI, which I got for Christmass from my parents. I also started with Python.</p>

    <li class="event" data-date="2024">
      <p>I switched high schools (I went from OAUH to SGaSOÅ ) and finally started to learn IT even in school. The first thing that I started learning was programming in the C and C++ languages.</p>
